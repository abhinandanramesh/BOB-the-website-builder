								<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
								<ul><li>I along with <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=180551915&authType=OUT_OF_NETWORK&authToken=Ka2k&locale=en_US&srchid=2219381331409599357259&srchindex=1&srchtotal=1&trk=vsrp_people_res_name&trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A2219381331409599357259%2CVSRPtargetId%3A180551915%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary' class='linkitem'>Harish G </a> built a real-time information retrieval system with various wireless interfaces to increase the reliability of data retrieval through redundancy in networks using a dual-core controller. The application device drivers were written using Linux file and signal handler functions and were compiled with the firmware flash logic, so that any Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS, GSM and GPS modules could be readily interfaced with just minimal configurations, without having to undergo the trouble of writing the application drivers</li><li> It was mainly built for those Indian hinterland power generation companies who could not invest large sum on network and cloud infrastructure to remotely monitor the operation of the power generation units,resulting in a decrease of productivity. This low cost consumer grade controller was programmed to continuously log the data on to the cloud and even notify the user through different available networks, which enabled pro-active solutions to various business operations through the analysis of the data stored on web, for an eventual increase in the productivity</li><li> The system was sold to iBridge Technologies for a decent sum, to monitor the operation of windmill units</li></ul>
